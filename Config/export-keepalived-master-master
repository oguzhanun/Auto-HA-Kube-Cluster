# ${STATE} is MASTER for one and BACKUP for all other hosts, hence the virtual IP will initially be assigned to the MASTER.
# ${INTERFACE} is the network interface taking part in the negotiation of the virtual IP, e.g. eth0.
# ${ROUTER_ID} should be the same for all keepalived cluster hosts while unique amongst all clusters in the same subnet. Many distros pre-configure its value to 51.
# ${PRIORITY} should be higher on the master than on the backups. Hence 101 and 100 respectively will suffice.
# ${AUTH_PASS} should be the same for all keepalived cluster hosts, e.g. 42
# ${APISERVER_VIP} is the virtual IP address negotiated between the keepalived cluster hosts.
